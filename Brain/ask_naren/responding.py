"""The one call the HTTP layer makes: a CSM's message in, a response body out.

This is the seam intake sits behind. It runs intake, then dispatches to the ANSWER PATH for
whichever intent came back (`ask-naren/CONTEXT.md`).

WHY THIS SITS ABOVE `answering.answer_situation` RATHER THAN INSIDE IT. That function is the
arm Ask Naren's measured accuracy was recorded on, and its prompts are frozen against ADR
0001. Keeping it callable EXACTLY as before means a re-measurement still compares against the
recorded number instead of a drifted one. Intake changes what reaches it; it does not change
it.

`classify` and `embed_query` are injected rather than imported, matching how `label_for` and
`moves_for` already work in this package: a dispatch test must not pay for a generation, and
routing accuracy is measured separately against labelled messages.

    `message` is what the CSM typed, framing and all. What reaches RETRIEVAL is intake's
    `retrieval_query` -- the client's own words -- which is the entire point: a request frame
    is boilerplate shared by every question, and adding one changes which exchange retrieval
    reaches for 81% of situations.

    `thread` is the conversation so far, held by the CALLER and replayed (issue #15). It
    reaches INTAKE, which cannot detect a follow-up, resolve its own clarify or avoid
    re-asking one without it. It NEVER reaches the embedded query -- ADR 0006 -- and the
    line below is where that holds: what gets embedded is `decision.retrieval_query`, which
    intake derives from THIS message alone. Defaults to empty, so `--ask` and every
    pre-thread caller behave exactly as before.

    INTAKE CANNOT TAKE THE TOOL DOWN. `intake.classify` already falls through to answering
    the message as written when the model or gateway misbehaves; the try here covers the
    remaining case of classify itself raising (an injected one in a test, or a future bug).
    Both land on the pre-intake behaviour, which is a working tool.

    It also answers ADR 0006's objection to query rewriting -- "a bad rewrite would be
    invisible in the response". Intake is ASKED for a verbatim span, but asking is not
    enforcing: a model told to copy will sometimes compose, and `measure_intake_accuracy.py`
    caught it doing exactly that, once with a perspective flip ("their side" -> "our side")
    that inverts meaning while staying near-identical in embedding space. Echoing the query
    is what makes that visible in production rather than only in an offline run.

    Safe to echo because `retrieval_query` derives from the CSM's OWN message -- it is never
    an answer, a quote or anything drawn from Naren's calls, so it cannot carry ungrounded
    content into a declined response. That, not its provenance, is the property that decides
